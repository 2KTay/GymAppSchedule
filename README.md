This is my Final project for CSCI 240.
This code was made in java

Motivation:
I like going to the gym and would appreciate it if I had a program that organized my workouts. I
would waste less time and can use this on a real-life day-to-day basis. As a result, I can
accomplish my gym goals and submit this Final Project.
